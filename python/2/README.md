This set explores each personal unique relaionship timeline. There are three prominent stages, each with their own visual attributes.
The random intertwining of each of these three stages create a unique narrative. Much like observing others, you can imagine a story with each piece.
Start from the middle of the circle, and spiral outward - project this persons life as the spiral grows bigger. 

Running the projection over and over creates a different timeline, and it's own unique story with it.

--------

The goal is to create a sort of 'wreath' that is haunting. Some ends fly away... other drift gently in the middle.

I think some of the classes should be:
1. Mothers
2. Lovers
3. Destructors
4. Drifters
